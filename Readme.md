2. [10-12 hours] Create your first homework/tutorial set
   - Lucie 
      - The tutorial for *Visualization* should be focused around "describing distributions" using terms like skew, symmetric, unimodal, median, percentile, quartile/IQR, mean, standard deviation, etc. I am expecting to rely primarily on the tutorial time to communicate these conceptual/conversational terminologies. Some of this could be included as an introduction into the homework as well, as a kind of "tutorial" in the homework to get students started on this.
      - The primary tutorial activity should follow up on the *Data Wrangling* tutorial exercise and be of the same style, using either the oly12countries data set or coffee.csv data set, or another data set that you think best lends itself to plotting and describing data distributions.
   - Matthew
      - *Hypothesis Tests* will introduce (one sample) permutation p-values; and, bootstrap confidence intervals will have already been covered, so operationalizing this simluation based methodology should be fairly comfortable as a topic for the students. Therefore, we'll also introduce the nonparametric sign (median, wilcoxon signed rank) test and the parametric t-test alternatives through their `scipy.stats` (`wilcoxon` and `ttest_1samp`, respectively) function calls. Considering all three tests allows us to compare and contrast simulation, nonparametric, and parametric testing, with the latter two being theoretical (rather than simulation-based) but only the t-test requiring a parametric assumption (since the underlying binomial distribution of the sign test is not an assumption, but a fact).  The video shows my treatment of this. I think it is too advanced to show how the sign and t-test work and how they calculate p-values using the binomial distribution and the t-distribution; but/and, I think the tutorial should be oriented around a mini-lecture/presentation/demonstration of a worked example of a hypothesis test for a proportion.
      - The "Wheel of Destiny" is probably a prime example to use for tutorial.
      - The tutorial should also spend time clarifying the difference between the data distribution and the sampling distribution of a test statistic.
      - *Two Samples* will reintroduce confidence intervals and the above hypothesis in a two-sample contexts (of the nonparametric permutation test and the two sample median test and t-test, `scipy.stats` `median_test` and `ttest_ind` repspectively) . This is meant to provide a second pass over the hypothesis testing material at a slightly more advanced level.
      - [Rohan, too] Coordination with Rohan is required regarding the "gender disparity paper" discussion exercise. I think this belongs in your tutorial weeks; so, then the reading/questions in Rohan's homework exercises should instead be treated  as a follow up discussion on that paper reading exercise.  The paper is quite a long one; so, go find it here (https://github.com/quin97/STA130_Tutorial_F22) and perhaps determine what the students should read (perhaps less than the whole paper).  
      - I think the tutorial material/conversations/questions going along with this paper should be moved to your tutorial weeks.
      - If I recall correctly, some of these questions have to do with an awareness of assumptions(?) and populations(?).
      - Based on the above, I would like to see you find away to introduce some discussion about populations and independent sampling as introduction material in your homeworks and "mini-reviews/lectures" as part of the tutorial slide decks you create.  
   - Rohan
      - See the "[Rohan, too]" item to Matthew above.
      - Based on your video messages, it seems that organizing the topics breakdown between the two regression weeks is the primary challenge here; and, that (becaues regression so centrally ties everything in this course together), threading the needle with the story arc of the regression weeks in a way that smoothely dovetails out of hypothesis testing and into machine learning classification decision trees will require a good amount of coordination with Matthew and Cole.
      - At the moment I think week 11 will introduce train/test data, and week 12 will reinforce that idea (along with generalizability, overfitting, and model complexity) with `GridSearchCV`; so, I'm not 100% sure that these topics need to be your focus; but, hinting at the mand beginning to introduce them of course is not a terrible idea.
      - Currently you're using the Week 9 homework to introduce facet plotting and then adding some problems to begin introducing the ideas of interactions and indicator variables.  I don't actually remember how I recorded this material, but spreading out the regression content between weeks 9 and 10 should be done with some intentionality and intensional planning and coordination.  And then this in turn to should coordinated and sequenced between Matthew's week 7/8 and Cole's week 11/12.
      - In tutorial you're planning to have a discussion about linearity (and I think the 4 regression assumptions, generally?), and also have an idea for another mini-lecture that introduces some code, a figure, and questions.  All your/these ideas here strike me as very good; but, they'll require a tight build on the tutorial slide deck.  I want the TAs tutorial plans to all be uniformized and clearly laid out with intention.  After this is done, there may or may not be time to give to the students to work on their project teams... let's see how your tutorial plans finalize and shape out.
      - Addressing the "Why use 2 indicator variable if there are three categories?" question in tutorial/homework be might a good content piece
   - Cole
      - `graphviz` was not working on jupyterhub during the Week 11 video recording; and, I spent the last 45 minutes of a 2 hour 45 minute recording to not get model complexity selection with `GridSearchCV` working. 
      - `graphviz` is now available ... I plan to (soon?) add a recording about model complexity, test/training data, generalizability with `GridSearchCV` (which I will figure out how to use for the recording).  This recording will also begin with a review of decision tree visualization based on `graphviz` now working and should be a good way to pick up from the last recording (which got cut off at around 2 hours).
      - It seems you and Steve have a good idea about the ethics topics that you can address; and/but, it seems to me that reproducibility/generalizability as seen through the lense of `GridSearchCV` and training/test data would nonetheless be a good topic to return to for week 12(?).
         - So, there are definitley options options for what to do in the last class between concluding with the generalizability `GridSearchCV` topics and ethics; though, this all seems likely to mean that the idea of doing a review on the last class will disappear (which is okay from my perspective). 
         - It seems likely that introducing reproducibility->algorithmic bias (while an interesting ethics topic that I think ties in to "out of sample performance" likely won't have time to make an appearance in the last class... and that seems okay to me... although, perhaps it could be introduced as a homework topic?)
      -  With all of this in mind I don't think you are very time rich in that last class as I initially thought... I'm okay with that though and I'm not particularly committed to using the last class for a review of any sort... happy to leave that to the students and their study groups... 
      -  It seems to me that this week is not particularly finalized and will require a descent amount of determination still... I do think there's still a good amount of opportunity and freedom in determining what should be done with this last class... that kinda just depends on what feels good to you and what you end up suggesting we do, I think (perhaps maybe).
